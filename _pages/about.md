I am a graduate student in the [Machine Learning Lab](https://mllab.csa.iisc.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://csa.iisc.ac.in), advised by [Chiranjib Bhattacharyya](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~chiru/). Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in the [Mathematics Department](https://math.iisc.ac.in) at IISc.

My research focuses on developing algorithms and models for quantum unsupervised learning.
